The code you are looking at is a fork made by catraeus:

Currently it is a good steady-Eddy midi snooper.
Time codes are cryptic
Why it has outputs is, my guess, only to pipe, merge, fork MIDI communications
  as the artist sees fit.
I hope to add:
  Timecodes from midnight.
  Control Channel morph - CCx -> CCy to enable a limited app that creates, e.g.
    Morph Wheel (CC2) output and put it to CC3, CC6 ... whatever CC you wish.

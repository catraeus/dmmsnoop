/* Architecture
    This class gives us the following:
      strings as non constants so we don't have to coerce const to non-const
      Movable, triple-starred old-school strings so we can instantly shift languages.
      an enum framework for groups of messages based on what part of the MIDI spec ehty come from
      an enum framework for language specification that is easily growable for the whole world.
      Dang, you can even change language on the fly!
